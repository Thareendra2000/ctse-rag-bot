      "In Swift, a closure is essentially a self-contained block of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Swift allows you to use a function as a type, just like an integer or a string. [Page 18].\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Functions as Types:** Swift treats functions as first-class citizens. This means you can assign a function to a variable. [Page 18].\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Capture Values:** Closures can \"capture\" references to constants and variables from the surrounding context (the scope in which they are defined). This is known as \"closing over\" values. [Page 18]. This means the closure can access and even modify those variables, even if the surrounding scope is no longer active.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Use Cases:** Closures are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to store some functionality to be executed later or repeatedly. Some common use cases include:\n",
      "    *   Waiting for a period of time before executing code. [Page 19].\n",
      "    *   Handling UI animations or interactions that need to complete before further actions are taken. [Page 19].\n",
      "    *   Asynchronous operations, such as network requests, where you want to execute code upon completion. [Page 19].\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example:** The lecture notes provide an example demonstrating a function `cooked(pizza: String, minutes: Int)` and its closure equivalent:\n",
      "\n",
      "```swift\n",
      "func cooked(pizza: String, minutes: Int) {\n",
      "    print(\"\\(pizza) Pizza is cooked in \\(minutes) minutes.\")\n",
